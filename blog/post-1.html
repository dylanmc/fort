<br> The initial version of fort has arrived!

<h2>Announcing fort v0.1.0 </h2>

<p>I'm very happy to announce that the initial version of fort has been released.</p>

<h2>Where to get it</h2>

<p>Fort is open source software so you can download it here: <a href="https://github.com/fortlang/fort">https://github.com/fortlang/fort</a></p>

<br><p>There you can find an overview of the fort language itself, source code for the compiler, test cases, and example programs written in fort.</p>

<h2>Word of warning</h2>

<p>There isn't currently much in the way of documentation and as you can tell from the version number this should be considered alpha (or pre-alpha!) level software.</p>

<br><p>However, all of the basic constructs are implemented so you can get a feel for writing code in fort and perhaps try it out on some examples of your own.  Any contributions/feedback would be much appreciated!</p>

<br><p>Every project has to start somewhere and hopefully from these humble beginnings fort can grow into something truly useful.</p>

<br>Cheers!
<br>Brett
