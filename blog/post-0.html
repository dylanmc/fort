<br>Let's talk a bit about the Fort programming language.

<h2>The goal</h2>

<p>To build something <em>useful</em>.</p>

<p>Ok, that's a little vague.</p>

<p>Specifically to build a programming language designed to be small and fast and
safe. Something you would want running aboard the next flight you take. Or
making that app on your phone faster. Or onboard a probe to Alpha Centauri. Or
behind your favorite videogame.</p>

<p>Small, fast, and safe isn't enough though. Any programming language should
also be <em>convenient</em>. Writing code is hard enough, the language should do
what it can to minimize what Jonathan Blow refers to as <em>friction</em>.</p>

<h2>Where did it come from?</h2>

<p>The concept behind Fort started many, many years ago. I've always had a
passion for programming but <em>*cough*</em>20<em>*cough*</em> years ago I was
fortunate enough to work with a group that was very involved with the
development and use of the Haskell programming language (check it
out! <a href="http://www.haskell.org">http://www.haskell.org</a>).</p>

<p>I still love and use Haskell (I'm developing Fort <em>in</em> Haskell) but oddly
enough, my second favorite language is C. There's nothing like the speed and
simplicity of C.</p>

<p>So there you have it, C-like performance with Haskell-like expressibility. That
just seems very <em>useful</em> to me.</p>

<h2>Where is it at?</h2>

<p>Up to this point all of my work on Fort has been in-house. Exploritory,
proof-of-concept experiments, so I could learn what worked and what didn't. What
I felt was user friendly and what wasn't. This has been extremely valuable to me
but I don't know that having a user base of <em>one</em> can be described as generally
useful. Not to mention that this project would greatly benefit from feedback to
help it grow and improve.</p>

<p>Inspired by Casey Muratori of Handmade Hero
(<a href="http://handmadehero.org">http://handmadehero.org</a>) and Andrew
Kelley of Zig (<a href="http://ziglang.org">http://ziglang.org</a>) I've come to
realize that usefulness can also come from the <em>process</em>. If the design
and development of Fort can be educational, inspire you to write and release
software, or you just find it curious, interesting, or perhaps
even <em>fun</em>, that would be fantastic.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, I just want Fort to be useful. I think that's a pretty
good goal.</p>

<br>Cheers,
<br>Brett
